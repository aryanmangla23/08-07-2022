Dunno if I will have time but here are the same questions:

Who do I need to still forgive and who am I still angry at? What is important to me now that wasn't important to me before?

relatively chill day, riya came again with bro and spend a lot of time with them. Slept cuz i was facing feels i cant describe yet. i have no fucking clue why im like so mellow. 

k read my convo and realized im so self centered. Thing to change. not so self centered, but useless things i bring up. kay

worked a decent amount. will work mostly tmrw :D and for next 3 days. ima be hyped to be working and not even trying to be sarcastic. im so elated to find time and actually focus in the library. 

Made 2 playlists today, not sure if that was wat i was feeling, but might be. I can't put my finger on what.

Realization: Most boys are chill with me, but all the girls or majority dislikes me without knowing who I am
